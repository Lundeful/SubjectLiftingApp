# SubjectLiftingApp

Just a demo repository for trying out the subject lifting feature of iOS, and how it can be used to let the users upload images with transparent background.

Right now it's targeted at iOS 16 and we cannot access the subjects programmatically, so the user will have to do it manually from the photos app.

I will update it to use iOS 17 features, where we can then programmatically extract the wanted subjects from the pictures the users provide.

It has simple Create, Read and Delete features backed by CoreData and CloudKit. No tests, no error handling. Just a quick demo.
